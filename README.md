# Primatetype
A project created by Kaesar, Deven, and Wilson. Inspired by [monkeytype.com], we decided to make our own version on command-line and the web.
# Installation
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://gtihub.com/KaesarWU/Primatetype-Project
```
Then change to the directory ```cd Primatetype-Project``` and compile with ```g++ main.cpp -o primatetype -std=c++17```. Note that for windows you may first have to install a compiler. After all that, run the program with ```./primatetype``` for mac or ```primatetype.exe``` for windows.
